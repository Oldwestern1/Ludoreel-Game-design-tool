        // A few names differ slightly from BGG's official mechanic title, either because this
        // app's list predates a BGG rename, or because several similar app items ("Bag Building" /
        // "Deck Building" / "Pool Building" / "Dice Building") all map to BGG's single combined
        // "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building" mechanic. Three more (Tableau Building, Roll and Write,
        // Closed Economy) point to a BGG "Mechanism:" *family* page rather than an official
        // "boardgamemechanic" page — BGG's community uses these terms constantly but never
        // formalized them as mechanic tags, so the family page (a community-curated list of games
        // using that mechanism, with a definition) is the closest real BGG resource that exists.
        // Closed Economy in particular is an approximate match: it points to BGG's narrower
        // "Closed-Economy Auction" mechanic page (an auction-specific meta-mechanism), since BGG has
        // no page for the broader "money never enters/leaves the game" concept this app means.
        //
        // A remaining few (Engine Building, Drawing Card/Tile, Follow the Leader, Shared Incentive /
        // Market Decay, and the umbrella "Asymmetric Information / Limited Communication") have no
        // BGG mechanic page *or* family page with a confident single match — Engine Building in
        // particular is deliberately not an official BGG tag at all (BGG's community has debated
        // adding it for years; see the forum threads). These are intentionally left out rather than
        // linked to something wrong, and fall back to a Wikipedia search like any other mechanic.
